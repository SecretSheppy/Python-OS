# Python-OS
Welcome!
This is a project that i thought would be great fun to do and share with the great people on the internet. I am going to be building and supporting this DOS operating system 100% programmed in python. so you can stick around, download it and use it however you like.

I think that this will be really cool in its later stages, however if you would like to use the framework to build a program of your own then i reccomend downloading the earlier versions of Python OS (0.0.1 etc...). I will try to put out a new update each month but if you have any questions on programming or why this etc feel free to join the Python OS discord here https://discord.gg/n9KtpCx

I hope you enjoy:

btw the Python OS.exe file is not a virus - its just a compressed setup file, works the same as when you install any other app, however if you are using an early version i reccomend installing it to your desktop as i havent build a shortcut for the executable file yet...
